  <h1>Here's a little bit about me...</h1>
  <div class="aboutme">
    <p>Hello! My name is Jared, I grew up in a small suburb called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyncourt,_New_York">Lyncourt</a> just on the outskirts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York">Syracuse, New York</a>. Growing up I've always managed to find a perfect balance between nature and technology, being close to both the city and more rural areas helped a lot.</p>
    <p>I enjoy staying physically active and keeping my mind strong by going to the gym for at least 1 hour, 5 times a week. To keep my mind healthy I practice meditation and read a lot of philosophy, from people such as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcus-aurelius/" target="_blank">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="https://www.niten.org/english/instituto/miyamoto_musashi/musashi-biografia" target="_blank">Miyamoto Mushashi</a></p>
    <p>I think what led me to pursue software development was just seeing the world change so rapidly as I've grown up. It seems like just yesterday to me that the first IPhone was released, how far we've come since just then alone baffles me. After a long period of questioning myself I decided I no longer wanted to be a bystander in this amazing world of technology. I want to be part of the change that I've seen, I fully believe I'm capable of amazing things!</p>
    <p>As far as my goals go I am a very ambitious person, I would like to secure a position as a Full Stack FAANG Software Engineer. I would love to stay specifically with Amazon as I think it would be absolutely amazing to go from a T1 employee to such a high position. I also find the Amazon work culture very welcoming and think that I would fit in very well, however I don't want to stop there. I eventually would like to lead a team of developers as I have the natural ability to be a leader.</p>

  <h1>My Strengths</h1>
  <div class="traits">
    <ul>
      <li>Quick Learner</li>
      <p>I've always picked up on new things very quickly, whether it's a new skill or just some new information!</p>
      <li>Great Communicator</li>
      <p>Communicating is something that comes natural to me, I really enjoy talking to and meeting new people, there's always something to learn from a stranger.</p>
      <li>Extremely Ambitious</li>
      <p>Aiming high is a way to make sure that you never hit too low, I strive to be the best in everything I do, I am very competitive but also cooperative.</p>
      <li>Positive Attitude</li>
      <p>I bring a positive attitude everywhere I go, being negative is far more exhausting to me.</p>
      <li>Super Creative</li>
      <p>My imagination is definitely one of my many strong suits, I've always considered myself to have an excellent artistic vision but no outlet to express it, seeing as I have never been much of a physical artist</p>
      <li>Leadership Values</li>
      <p>When you combine all of these things they make the perfect leader, I am someone who can make sure that no one feels left out and lead a team to success. Leading a team is no easy task, but I believe when given the opportunity I naturally take charge.</p>
      <li>Humble yet Confident</li>
      <p>While I like to hold myself to high standards, I do not like to hold others to the same standards. I am confident in my ability but also humble enough to not allow that to affect my views on others.</p>
    </ul>
